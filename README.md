## Attribute Information:

1. CRIM: per capita crime rate by town 
2. ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. 
3. INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town 
4. CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

6. RM: average number of rooms per dwelling 
7. AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 
8. DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres

10. TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000 
11. PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town 
12. B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town 
13. LSTAT: % lower status of the population 
14. MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

## Data Analytics

The analysis looks at: 
- The relationship between median housing values and the home age
- The correlation between crime rate and student/ teacher ratio at local schools
- The proportion of black citizens within a suburb and the distance from that suburb to employment centers
- The connection between home values, nitrus oxide contamination, and proximity to industrial centers
- The relationship between crime rate and proportion of non-retail businesses
